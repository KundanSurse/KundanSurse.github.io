Nice to see you here !

I am a Ph.D. candidate at **University of New South Wales** in the Department of Physics. I work in Professor Rajib  Rahman's  group ([lab website](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-rajib-rahman)) on **Semiconductor quantum computing and Codencesed Matter Physics**. 


### Publications :
